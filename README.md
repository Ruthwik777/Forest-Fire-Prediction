# ðŸŒ² Forest Fire Prediction ðŸ”¥

This project predicts the risk of **forest fires** using **Logistic Regression**.  
The implementation is done **from scratch** without using built-in ML libraries (like scikit-learn for model training), to understand the mathematics and working of logistic regression.  

It uses historical forest fire dataset (`forest_fire_data.csv`) and a Python script (`forestfire.py`) to train, test, and evaluate the model.
